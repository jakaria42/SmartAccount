1. copy the script file in a location. (I used the location "C:\Murad Boss\final script.sql")


2. run the command in "start menu/run"


sqlcmd -S .\sqlexpress -i "C:\Murad Boss\final script.sql" -o "C:\Murad Boss\final script_output.txt"


NOTE:

In the command line
	-S means server instance name
	-i means input file location
	-o means output file location

after run the command a file will be generated at location C:\Murad Boss\final script_output.txt
open the file to see the output.

Hope this will work.
